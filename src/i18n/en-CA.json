      "standard": "Depth {depth} ({halfMoves} half-moves ahead) is where solid tactical analysis begins. Most one-move threats and two-move combinations are clearly visible to the engine.",
      "deep": "At depth {depth} Stockfish searches {halfMoves} half-moves ahead. It is now evaluating multi-piece combinations, sacrifices, and medium-horizon strategic plans with high confidence.",
      "very_deep": "Depth {depth} — {halfMoves} half-moves of full tree search. Analysis at this level uncovers deep combinations that humans rarely see over the board. Evaluations are highly reliable.",
      "extreme": "Depth {depth} is extreme. Stockfish is exploring {halfMoves} half-moves ahead, far beyond human calculation. At this depth the principal variation reflects near-optimal play for both sides."

  "why_depth_panel": {
    "panel_header": "Why Depth Matters",
    "explanation": "Chess has roughly 35 legal moves per position. Every extra ply (half-move) multiplies the search tree by ~35×. Shallow searches miss deep combinations; deeper searches find lines that no human could calculate at the board. Stockfish uses alpha-beta pruning and NNUE (neural-network) evaluation to cut irrelevant branches and reach high depths efficiently."
